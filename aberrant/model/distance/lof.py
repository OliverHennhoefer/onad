class LocalOutlierFactor(BaseModel):
    """
    Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for online anomaly detection.

    LOF identifies anomalies by comparing the local density of a point
    with the local densities of its neighbors. Points with significantly
    lower density than their neighbors are considered outliers.

    This implementation maintains a sliding window of observations and
    computes LOF scores on demand.

    Note:
        Time Complexity: ``score_one`` has O(k × n) complexity where n is the
        window size, as it computes distances for each of k neighbors. For
        high-throughput scenarios with large windows, consider using smaller
        k values or reducing window_size. River's ILOF uses incremental
        updates for better amortized performance.

    Args:
        k: Number of neighbors to use for density estimation. Default is 10.
        window_size: Maximum number of points to keep in the window.
            Default is 1000.
        distance: Distance metric to use. Either "euclidean" or "manhattan".
            Default is "euclidean".

    Example:
        >>> lof = LocalOutlierFactor(k=5, window_size=500)
        >>> for point in data_stream:
        ...     lof.learn_one(point)
        ...     score = lof.score_one(point)
        ...     if score > 1.5:  # LOF > 1 indicates outlier
        ...         print("Anomaly detected!")
